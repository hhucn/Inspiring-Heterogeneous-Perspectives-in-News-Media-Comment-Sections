20;stsb-mpnet-base-v2;International trade relations are far too complex for a know-nothing like Trump. But he does know ho to use his office to put money in his pocket. <br/><br/>After moving into the Oval Office, he began to court Taiwan and challenge the One-China policy. Then suddenly, he changed his tune about China policy once the Chinese agreed to grant him 38 new trademarks worth untold millions or even billions. Trump is running the country like it is just part of his family business.  In fact he brought in his usual family partners to carry most of the daily burden of office.  <br/><br/>When Trump can find some time away from the golf course he must be impeached!;;-1.0;;;Trump markets himself as the deal maker. He must be very good at it because investors pay him millions just to put his name on buildings -- whether those buildings (or casinos) make any economic sense.<br/><br/>But his deal-making skills are clearly not working so well in his new position. So far, no deal with China on trade, nor with NATO, nor with Mexico, and there's no deal in sight in the Middle East to persuade Israel and its mortal enemies to combine forces to oust  ISIS or take over Iraqi oil. No deal on repeal and replace, likely no deal on the BAT, and still no deal on building and paying for his beautiful wall.<br/><br/>However, it should be also noted that one of his sons recently inked a deal for a new Trump-branded building in South America, so there's that.;"I am shocked; shocked that our POTUS has no idea what he is talking about. Trouble is his base STILL think he does.<br/><br/>He wants to renegotiate America's ""horrible trade deals"" in a way that he can benefit.<br/><br/>Step one: Badger China until they grant him all of his ""Trump"" brand trademarks within China. [Check.]<br/>Step two: Continue to badger China until they grant him favorable access to real estate and other lucrative opportunities within China and increased Chinese membership at Mar-a-Lago. [Workin' on it end of the week.]<br/>Step three: Renegotiate a more lucrative deal for his kid-in-law for the toddler's 666 property.<br/>Step four: Beat up on Mexico in order to negotiate lucrative deals for himself in Mexico - like a Rebranded ""Don Julio Tequila"" to ""Don Trump Tequila"" and ""Scion"" industrial parks for American industry in Mexico.<br/>Step five: ....<br/><br/>Note: Above steps are all behind the scenes not visible to the American People, for obvious reasons! The nothingburgers and all the apparent failed agenda is for public consumption and a distraction instead.<br/><br/>We need to study the causes of the trade deficit in order to arrive at and validate Trump's preconceived conclusions. You know, like studies into Obama wire tapping, millions of illegal votes, and ...<br/><br/>Small hands can only carry a small stick. Lets hope the nuke 'em button is too large for him to push.<br/><br/>This reality show needs to be cancelled ASAP!";Is Trump wimping out on trade or is he meeting reality and seeing that what he wants to do versus what he can do have to be reconciled into some sort of action that will be passed?  I realize that that is too much to hope for but it may be what is occurring.  We need to trade.  Humans have always traded what they have in return for what they need.  In fact, if we didn't trade we'd have more wars.  Trade forces us to cooperate, to protect each other, and may lead to lasting relationships.  Those relationships can play a positive role in our private lives and, in the case of nations, in how the world works.  <br/><br/>The other possibility is that Trump is planning to throw out some more incendiary remarks to undermine our relationships with the rest of the world but he hasn't felt the itch to Tweet yet.  That's a more frightening scenario because words mean something and the wrong ones can hurt us with our trading partners.;'But governing America isn’t like reality TV. A few weeks ago Mr. Trump whined, “Nobody knew that health care could be so complicated.” Now, one suspects, he’s saying the same thing about trade policy.'<br/><br/>A good summary.  It emphasizes a basic truth regarding Trump's many utterances and tweets that are well illustrated by his comments on health care.  During the campaign we were told that we'd see a healthcare-for-all-plan that would be better, cheaper, and that it would be easy to bring about.  The real message, the basic truth, was that Trump had no idea of what he was talking about.  And that lack of knowledge continues with respect to nearly every other subject area.  How much time has he really spent pouring over the complexities of tax plans or national budgets?  As much as tweeting time?;“Trade wars are good, and easy to win.” As usual the impulsive, arrogant, simpleton sees the issue through one lens, his. He fails to understand that trade agreements and tariffs are complex transactions, subject to negotiation and quid pro quo bargaining - and they reflect networking and good will. But for the dimwit at the top it's more of the same... my way or the highway. That's why POTUS declared bankruptcy so many time.;And who knew tax reform would be so complicated?  Navigating the reefs between tax and trade policies will prove too much.  Might as well just continue to promote Trump properties on weekends and grab as much payola as can be found.  The President might become a billionaire yet before he leaves office.

I used to log on to my computer and without thinking type <a href=""http://Facebook.com"" title=""Facebook.com"" target=""_blank"">Facebook.com</a> but no more. I am so relieved it’s incredible how much people are sucked into that. No more distant people I wish were gone than lingering. I have whatsapp notifications muted it’s on my time I check my msgs. I highly recommend you utilize the tech in your phone and get yourself some much needed privacy. Cheers";;-1.0;;;Won’t have it in my house. No Facebook. No Instagram.;I restricted my kids' usage until they were high school.  No regrets.  I also made it clear up until they were 16 that I could review any and all content that was made public (not their private e mails, etc.).  My daughter spends a billion minutes each day on her social media stuff, but my son is much more mellow.;Did you know Instagram now allows disappearing pics and videos? So annoying! Before 13, I shared an account with my son. It looked like his account but I was logged in on my phone at all times and saw everything. MANY teachable moments. Now he is thirteen and I'm taking some of the training wheels off  - but not all! ;So parents now encourage their kids to join social media platforms (even if they themselves 'monitor' them and 'have conversations') so that kids can 'find their people'? This to me sounds like 'I'll let the kid find virtual playmates online because I can't (or won't) spend the time helping him find them in the real world, where they can actually share the space in which they do their flips'. Not a good look.;I caught my 10 year old with an Instagram account.  I looked up their terms of service, and it said you had to be 13, so I deleted her account.<br/><br/>I have an old ipod air that I've cloned to her apple account, and monitor her usage in real time.  Much like that Southern politician who was texting his mistress on his iphone while his wife was at home, reading the texts on his cloned ipad.;I don’t use social media. I have no need for it. It’s not a necessary thing to have in order to have a rich and fulfilling life. So I don’t need to introduce it to my child. Instead I read to my child, and my child reads. Why is social media treated as something so important?

No matter how ""degraded"" the relationship is and was, Putin's bet on Trump is allowing him to foster nationalist claims in his country, motivation to meddle in European elections , and continue to defend Syria's dictator. Trump ran as a strong and decisive leader. He had demonstrated, due to ignorance, unpreparedness and inconsistency, that he is not. In the world, the US had become a joke. Under pres. Obama foreign policy and diplomatic engagement, and sometimes precise force, kept the US in a better position. Some may say it was weakness, but the world always listened with attention what Obama would do. He had a policy. Granted, Syrian policy was horrible, because there is no real policy toward a country that is consuming itself. Only humanitarian help must be negotiated (unless there's a process to avoid or eliminate Russia's veto power at the UN). Trump is no puppet, but he's a negligent leader with no vision.";The most charitable interpretation of these events is that Trump is so ignorant of and has thought so little of foreign affairs he does a 180 at the blink of an eye. Before the gas attack, Assad and the Russians have been bombing, shelling, and starving Syrian civilians for years. Yet, Trump still wanted both as his anti-ISIS allies. Now Trump says Assad has to go (mirroring Obama's position years ago.) Maybe if Trump actually attended national security briefings he wouldn't need to make this stuff up as he goes along.<br/><br/>The less charitable interpretation is this public tiff between Trump and Putin came at a very opportune time, when the Trump administration is being investigated for its Russian ties and Trump's popularity is lower than ever. This seems like an ostentatious way to dispel accusations, without any implementing actual concrete policies. ;Trump and his equally Russian compromised Secretary of State Tillerson will utter some lame protests and do nothing to oppose Putin. Russia has the goods on Trump and Tillerson, and as puppets they are totally in cahoots with Russia.;The corner stone of international arms control is not one specific treaty. It is trust.

";;-1.0;;;This article is so absurd I am only going to deal with one of the many issues which make it's goals impossible.  Land use restrictions exist for many reasons, including quality of life.  I'm sure that housing would be cheaper in Manhattan if we bulldozed Central Park and filled with high density housing.  But what sane person would support that trade off?  If we packed San Francisco to the density of Hong Kong it might reduce prices and housing shortages but how many of the current residents would vote for that?;I would say to Mr. Soloviev, as a resident of the United Nations neighborhood where his new building has risen, that the website for that building is disingenuous.  The renderings show it across the street from park-like greenery.  Not the case. It is instead across from a lot that is an eyesore at best...a lot that he intends to build on, blocking the views of those who purchase in the new tower. If I met Mr. Soloviev, I would suggest instead that those blocks be turned into parkland, with bike paths and running paths and benches and playgrounds and all the things a real neighborhood actually needs.  We do not need more condos. We do not need a fancy restaurant or more office space.  We need places where communities can come together, enjoy being outdoors, get some exercise and share time with one another regardless of economic standing.  That lot is PERFECT for such a space, and were Mr. Soloviev (who is not exactly poor) a real mensch, he might just do it.  I know his father would not and would build there to get every penny he can...I wish that Mr. Soloviev would choose a different path and give the neighborhood a true and timeless gift.  It would mean much more, for generations to come, than new glass condos.;This article and the academic studies it cites are pro-development agitprop and serve a specific agenda: to dismantle local land use regulation, such as zoning and environmental protections, that are essential to protecting public health, parks/open space, community self-governance, and quality of life in America's neighborhoods. Why not instead promote policies that will foster entrepreneurship and attract businesses and jobs to regions with cheap housing? <br/><br/>If the authors want to live in super dense mega-cities, I invite them to move to Mexico City, Tokyo, or Beijing, or to try living in a tiny dumpster box themselves. I guarantee you that efforts to destroy land-use regulation, such as Jerry Brown's recent proposals in California, will be met with fierce and widespread resistance by liberals and conservatives alike.;"Clever of the author to launch an attack against regulations by crouching it in terms of prudent personal finance and increased housing stock.  Instead of ""Drill, Baby, Drill!"",  ""It's Build, Baby, Build""!<br/><br/>Potential and actual homeowners are often naive about the costs of homeownership, which includes not only the price, interest on the mortgage, homeowners insurance and property taxes but maintenance and repair costs, both anticipated and unanticipated.  Many would be better off renting.<br/><br/>While its true that expanding the housing stock by deleting regulations would likely bring the price of homes down,  it is also true that increasing density in already dense metro areas will tax metropolitan governments to provide services.  Think of the new housing development without roads, street lights, sewers, electricity and schools.  The NIMBY battles will tax the courts.  I can just imagine the residents of posh single family neighborhoods welcoming the building of high rises obscuring their view.  And, no consideration is to be given for sustainability and safety?   There are some places where housing is not safe from natural forces - just ask the residents of steep canyons in the LA hills.<br/><br/>So, while rethinking the home as investment is good, let's not think the solution to housing is to eliminate restrictions and build, build, build.";It's disingenuous not to include the downside of the elimination of all zoning restrictions. One-acre lots will have eight or more homes spring up. Residences will be built next to slaughterhouses and garbage dumps. Landscapes will be forever changed as parks are converted to high-density housing. Cultural, artistic and non-profit institutions will wither when the rules that govern the highest and best (read: most profitable) use of the land are scrapped.

Maybe the Europeans don't believe that Russia would actually take up arms against the West. They might be right. Tough call...;"""In anticipation of the missile deployment, the Obama administration funded a new multibillion-dollar initiative to station American troops and those from other NATO members on a rotating basis in European countries near the Russian border, and to expand training exercises and other cooperation""<br/><br/>That's a pretty slippery statement that bears clarification: in other words, before the Russians actually deployed the controversial missile, Washington preemptively deployed troops on the Russian border - an extremely provocative reaction, esp to something that hasn't happened yet.<br/><br/>And no mention of Washington's most provocative action: deploying anti-missile systems along the Russian border (widely understood to be offensive in nature) despite verbal assurances to Gorbachev that they would not deploy such technology. And to top it all off, the bogus rationale offered for the missile defense system was to to protect Europe from Iranian missiles - but the Iranians have yet to develop missiles with that kind of range, and of course, the Iranians have no motive for attacking Europe.<br/><br/>Such is the Times' subservience to power - lies, omissions and distortions take the place of journalistic integrity. And with a certified nutcase in the White House - what better time to urge provocations?";Get your facts straight. Germany didn't say they wouldn't increase their spending. they only said 1.they wouldn't do it more quickly than they are planning, 2. considering today's type of threats, it should be noted that they spend a lot on aid (which could help in decreasing the number of people prone to radicalisation)<br/>Still, of course,  it would be advisable if all nato countries did spend as much as pledged.<br/><br/>The US has of course every right to decide to spend less on defence, but so far your governments defined your national interests globally,which naturally meant huge Pentagon budgets.;"Few - I'm sure Trump was starting to worry he wouldn't have a ""real"" war on his watch.<br/><br/>Now we just need to bolster than flagging military of ours. They don't get NEARLY enough money. Oh wait - it's the opposite of that. ";"Well, we just got the answer from Germany not long ago about how worried Europe is about Russia.  Germany answered the American demand to step up to the 2% GDP defense funding with an emphatic ""no.""<br/><br/>So until the Europeans decide to step up to their own defense needs, what do the editors actually propose?<br/><br/>American options really boil down to increased economic sanctions, which the Europeans have grown weak-kneed over the past year, or increased defense spending.<br/><br/>Every dollar of increased defense spending on our part is a dollar denied domestic programs.  Whether or not Trump is a Putin puppet or a Pentagon puppet is irrelevant.  The issue is where the United States should be investing its resources.<br/><br/>Its really long overdue that Europeans shoulder their share of the common defense interests they talk about.  ";Would we in the West be willing, in return for Russia scrapping this missile, to withdraw the rotating NATO troop missions near Russia's border? And to give Russia an ironclad assurance that Ukraine will not be invited to join NATO? If we continue with moves that can be construed by the Russians as aggressive, it is hardly surprising that they react in kind.

On the other hand, before we built the museum of the Native American at the Smithsonian in DC, we did practically destroy their cultures.<br/><br/>Incidentally, I sincerely doubt that the mainstream Presbyterian congregation in Morristown would ever make anyone who wanted to study or admire the church feel unwelcome inside or out of the building. It’s just not how these folks roll. Maybe that should be the test - take public money and you open your doors to the public. ALL THE PUBLIC.;While I agree that the First Amendment's Establishment Clause should be strictly interpreted so as to bar any government funding or support of religion, and that to paraphrase Ben Franklin, any religion that does not support itself so that it is obliged to seek help from civil authorities is a sign of it's not being a worthwhile religion, the New Jersey Supreme Court did not rely on the Federal Constitution's Establishment Clause to declare the county funding unconstitutional. It carefully reviewed the history of New Jersey's Religious Aid Clause, expressly noting that it predated the US Constitution and remained a fixture of the New Jersey Constitution from it inception in 1776, through the constitution revisions of 1844 and 1947.  The granting of funds to religious institutions was contrary to the plain language of New Jersey's Religious Aid Clause. And rightfully so. ;I would like to see the reaction of the Court (and Republicans) when Muslims, Catholics and Jews apply for grants.  What I didn't see is the facts of this case.  Since the money is for pre-school playgrounds, my guess is that churches use those playgrounds for childcare during services.  How could you be closer tied to the religion?  And what is the religious make-up of the children who use the playground.  Are Muslims welcome to use it?  I worry that this is the precursor that will be the basis of a ruling that federal voucher programs can be used by religious schools without violating the separation of church and state - another travesty.  Wake up Justices and do your job.  Protect the Constitution.;"While I see the author's point, using the case about the Lutheran Church is a poor example. The state regularly gives funds to religious organizations to fund non-religious activity, i.e. homeless shelters and grants for security at mosques and synagogues. The oral arguments for this case made it seem that there was actually some consensus between the liberal and conservative justices (contrary to the author's main point that consensus is now gone); it was wrong for the school to be denied access to state funds for playground construction solely because the children playing on that playground are religious.  ";I'm sure this won't work with our current Supreme Court configuration but I have an idea. What if the barrier to the separation between church and state were a two-way street? If a religious institution wants to receive public funds, they forgo their tax exempt status. Furthermore, the institution is required to provide unfettered access to all medical care regardless of the institution's religious beliefs. I'm specifically referring to birth control but I'm sure you understand.<br/><br/>Point being: If you take from the public coffers, you need to respect public institutions regardless of your right to religious freedom. Your choice.;I wonder how people would react if it was an Islamic mosque of the Salafist/Wahabbi persuasion seeking taxpayer historical preservation funds to repair the mosque dome.

Throughout an ugly campaign and into his presidency, President Trump has demonized Muslims as terrorists and dehumanized many groups of marginalized people. ...""<br/><br/>Oh please!  Spare us your Left sanctimoniousness. This behavior on campuses has been common long before Trump even considered running for office.  Jewish students who dared defend Israel from Left anti-Semites posing behind human rights rhetoric have been the target of intimidation tactics for years now.  Speakers and students who don't mouth the inviolable catechism of Students for Justice in Palestine, who reject Nicht Kaufen Bei Juden -- I mean the BDS movement -- have been shouted down, their seminars disrupted, roughed up, along with violence, destruction of property, and even Jew-hating graffiti such as ""Zio"" spray painted on Jewish students' doors by Left-fascists.  And no one blamed this on Obama pandering to Iran, the Muslim Brotherhood or the Palestinian Authority.<br/><br/>Even now Left liberal causes such as Black Lives Matter and the Women's March movement are promoting BDS or even placing convicted murderers in prominent roles.<br/><br/>If you want to begin the slow road back to civility, the Left should start by taking a good hard look in the mirror.  Looks to me Ms Stanger, you should start doing so yourself.  This self-serving self-pity only perpetuates the problem.";I'm confused. You say  American Universities Must Take a Stand???....Really? You mean like in Berkeley where students last week rioted and tear gassed conservatives  because a controversial blogger was invited to speak. Or do you mean like Missouri where journalists were prevented from covering a public event and were harassed by protesters. Or Yale where a young girl shrieked obscenities at a Professor over Halloween costumes. Or maybe you mean like your own college Bard where students went ballistic when Michael Bloomberg was invited to be the commencement speaker. When do Universities ever stand up for freedom of expression or thought ?  Left-wing student activism is aimed at shutting down ALL challenging viewpoints. What’s happening at these colleges should be greatly distressing for all of us but especially you Mr. Botstein. Funny how you didn't mention this in your column. We’re allowing coddled children to chart the course of American academia, and it is entirely unacceptable. Living in Trump World is far from ideal. But I'll take that any day of the week over the oppressive authoritarian atmosphere at American Universities that doesn't allow any dissent from the liberal orthodoxy in any form. ;It appears that free speech is only tolerated by the bleeding heart liberals and those with a moderate or conservative bent are either attacked or not allowed to voice their opposing views.  Ms. Stranger is very lucky that she did not suffer permanent damage by these thugs.  <br/><br/>It appears that the universities are being run by a criminal element who do not care to learn but only want to create bedlam and mischief.  What about those who did want to hear Charles Murray present his speech?  They were denied that opportunity which shows there is a bias on college campuses today.  Conservatives must be allowed to speak and this nonsense of silencing of opposing viewpoints must end.<br/><br/>Colleges should prosecute and expel students who cause damage and harm to others and then maybe they will take their education seriously.;"Just because you think it might be beneficial to control immigration does not make you a Nazi.<br/>Just because you disagree with the unchallenged, politically correct opinions of the past 20 years does not make you guilty of hate speech.<br/>Don't liberals see that it's their own sensitivities that is preventing them from meaningfully entering this debate?<br/>Grow a pair, get yourself a well organized and informed argument together and debate the alt-right. Otherwise you're just going to continue to look like a group of petulant, spoiled brats, while the alt-right take even greater control of the high moral ground.<br/><a href=""https://jimdroberts.wordpress.com/2017/03/14/attempts-to-understand-the-alt-right-1-the-birth/?iframe=true&amp;theme_preview=true"" title=""https://jimdroberts.wordpress.com/2017/03/14/attempts-to-understand-the-alt-right-1-the-birth/?iframe=true&amp;theme_preview=true"" target=""_blank"">https://jimdroberts.wordpress.com/2017/03/14/attempts-to-understand-the-...</a>";"""Political life and discourse in the United States is at a boiling point...""

We have probably spent a trillion dollars (nobody really knows these numbers) on missile defense, and in spite of their doubtful efficacy, have lulled many in the security and foreign policy establishment into believing that the nuclear stalemate has broken in our favor, and that we can now win a nuclear war. On any given day, there must be 10 hysterical anti-Russia articles even in the most respectable of papers, a pattern one recognizes from our road to past conflict, except this is not some weak state. Liberals? they are as lost as the neocons these days. Putin is reminding the west that any fantasy about fighting Russia and returning home to normalcy during off-rotation should be replaced with a very healthy dose of reality. The fire will burn everyone everywhere. We are back in a new arms race, and it was our mismanagement of the aftermath of the last through hubris greed and bullying that caused it. ";You do not appear very curious as to why Russia is expanding these short range missiles. <br/><br/>Placing THAAD systems on Russia's border, and now possibly troops, is a provocative move. <br/><br/>But one must not question Lockheed Martin's revenue streams.;"""In anticipation of the missile deployment, the Obama administration funded a new multibillion-dollar initiative to station American troops and those from other NATO members on a rotating basis in European countries near the Russian border, and to expand training exercises and other cooperation""<br/><br/>That's a pretty slippery statement that bears clarification: in other words, before the Russians actually deployed the controversial missile, Washington preemptively deployed troops on the Russian border - an extremely provocative reaction, esp to something that hasn't happened yet.<br/><br/>And no mention of Washington's most provocative action: deploying anti-missile systems along the Russian border (widely understood to be offensive in nature) despite verbal assurances to Gorbachev that they would not deploy such technology. And to top it all off, the bogus rationale offered for the missile defense system was to to protect Europe from Iranian missiles - but the Iranians have yet to develop missiles with that kind of range, and of course, the Iranians have no motive for attacking Europe.<br/><br/>Such is the Times' subservience to power - lies, omissions and distortions take the place of journalistic integrity. And with a certified nutcase in the White House - what better time to urge provocations?";Were the old cruise missiles all that vulnerable? Remember it is much more expensive to make a defensive anti-missle missile than to make the offensive missile in the first place. The country making the offensive missile can just make more than the defending country can afford to defend against.  So it was a non-issue from the start, and I would invite the US news media to report it as such. ;"I heard a different Putin. Until now nuclear missiles have always been ""invincible"" - nobody can stop them. They were the perfect deterrent Only very recently we see some efforts - like the US missile shields in Eastern Europe and Korea - that shows some promise to stop ICBMs. AT the same time we see the US military making moves that lower the threshold to use nuclear weapons on the battlefield.<br/><br/>So Putin had to do something to restore the deterring power of the Russian nuclear arsenal - as he is perfectly aware that his conventional military isn't feared that much in the West. And restoring that deterrence is what he says is being done.<br/><br/>So let us stop the hyperbole. Putin is just saying that things will stay like they always were.";"""Other weapons the Russian leader discussed included a new ballistic missile called Sarmat that could round either pole and could overcome any antimissile defense system.""<br/><br/>This one liner is rather important. The US (and secondarily Israel) have put a lot of resources into anti-ballistic missile defense. This has been in spite of critics observing from the start that for every dollar spent on defensive missiles a few pennies of followup research on the other side can allow incoming missiles to regain the advantage.

You might as well say all Jews don't welcome gentiles in their midst, if your only sample is Kiryas Joel, or that all Christians want homosexuals to die, if your only sample is Westboro Baptist, Kevin Swanson, and the Ugandan government.  <br/><br/>Bad things happen when you stop seeing others as individuals like you, and start seeing them as faceless, one-dimensional blobs.  ;Right.  What the constitution does do is prohibit coercive religion.  The gov is supposed to stay out of religious arguments between the citizens it governs.  The SCOTUS isn't supposed to decide cases of religious controversies.  To do so would be unconstitutional.

I am not sure whether methadone clinics were part of the Chinese strategy....";;-1.0;;;"A Reefer Madness editorial from the Times - channeling the same history that went into a famous Sherlock Holmes story about opium addiction in the Victorian Era (""The Man with the Twisted Lip"").  Yes, opium has been around for centuries, and its effects can be dire.  Yes, people are dying from overdoses right now.  But (as several commenters have already noted) this has led to an instant scorched earth policy on the part of physicians in the US, so who knows how many thousands of people who (a) don't abuse prescription painkillers, and (b) are at no risk of addiction, are being denied the medication they need to function as human beings, in order to satisfy a public narrative that ""something must be done.""  It's undoubtedly a wrenching dilemma, but I find the all-or-nothing melodrama, the lack of nuance espoused by the public press, to be part and parcel of the problem";"I am weary of the ""mission"" of the NYTimes to stigmatize opioid use even more than it already is, making the lives of those suffering in pain even more painful.  <br/><br/>What you are doing borders on propaganda.  Nowhere in this article does it mention the high levels of physical violence Americans face, the number of wars we engage in, our high incarceration rates, our poor enforcement of workplace safety rules, our general lack of an inclusive social safety net -- all primary causes of broken bodies and therefore addiction.<br/><br/>Two years ago the singer Prince died of an accidental Fentanyl overdose because he thought he was taking a Vicodin 5/500.  Why was Prince was forced to buy hydrocodone off the street?  Because ""authorities"" like the Times engage in spreading paranoia and sensationalism to sell papers, which encourages the DEA to revoke the prescription licenses of doctors treating pain.<br/><br/>Have you no decency?<br/><br/>Please find another mission before I find another newspaper.";"Thank you to the editors of the NYT for keeping up the public pressure on the government and for keeping the public aware of the devastation that opioids are wreaking on our country and its people.  The number of overdose deaths is relatively tiny to the number of people adversely affected by this disease...multiply by at least by the number of parents and siblings who suffer never ending stress, who pay thousands of dollars to rehab facilities in the hope that they will help turn around their loved one's disease, usually without success.<br/><br/>My daughter's addiction physician told me ""If there is an evil in the world, it is heroin - it is truly hell on earth.""  Having lived with my daughter's heroin addiction for 7 years, and just found out about my other daughter's addiction to alcohol, cocaine, and now heroin for ten years, I can attest to the truth of that statement.<br/><br/>We need our leaders to help us battle this enemy, and we need our neighbors to find the compassion to help us.";Innovator, the detail that the NYT neglected to mention in the editorial is that once you become a Suboxone doctor, you (naturally) begin to treat junkies.<br/><br/>Every doctor has had the experience of treating junkies during training (perhaps longer than that), and very, very, very few of us has any interest in treating any more of them, if we can possibly avoid it, not to mention the fact that we do not want to have junkies sitting in our waiting rooms, repelling our decent patients.  It's pretty much the same among non-doctors:  Do YOU want to live next door to a methadone clinic?  Few do.  <br/><br/>If the DEA would permit doctors to see Suboxone patients exclusively, and in volume, that would allow addiction specialists to see large numbers of patients at their clinics, and allow those patients to be treated properly, but by limiting the number of patients one doctor can see, they force that patient load to be spread out amongst non-specialists, and create a situation where clinics are constantly trying to recruit new part--time doctors to pick up small fractions of the load, which is difficult to do because of the schedule disruptions and possible contract violations it can cause for the doctor.;So glad the NYT caught Big Pharma trying to influence the addiction/recovery advocacy world.  They are shameless and disgusting to do this. Haven't we had enough suffering from Big Pharma's reckless greed already?;What is missing in the national discussion, and certainly in the NYT comments, is the over-arching personal responsibility for one's actions.<br/><br/>If anyone needs prescription pain meds, and are denied access to needed medicines by the irresponsible behvior of those who abuse these drugs and cannot or will not take responsibility for their actions, then that is detrimental to all in our 21st century society. <br/><br/>We don't blame the liqour makers for alcoholism, which is much more widespread and damaging to our social fabric.

This is not Germany of the 1930's and their insistence that it is just makes them look more like the delusional, out of touch with reality nut jobs they are.";"""The American university’s future, indeed its most fundamental reason for being, is imperiled by a government that constructs walls on the Mexican border, restricts Muslim immigrants and denigrates the idea of America as a destination for refugees.""<br/><br/>What?  What a complete load of self-serving nonsense.  Having a border and restricting illegal aliens will damage the ability of colleges to function?  <br/><br/>How about colleges start clamping down on the violence seen last week at Berkeley, and ridding themselves of the muslim brotherhood supporters/apologists presenting themselves as ""mideast scholars"", whose sole function is to attack Israel, jews and the US (filth like rashid khalidi come to mind)?<br/><br/>When a sizable portion of colleges charge more than what an average american family earns in a year, having bloated themselves with lots of high-paying, useless make-work jobs like ""diversity coordinator"", and offering utter trash majors like ""women's studies"", I simply don't have a lot of sympathy for people like Leon claiming how important universities are to maintaining the truth in a democracy.

412;stsb-roberta-base-v2;It’s clear that the Republican Party of today has no interest in the rule of law, no interest in defending democracy, and no interest in defending the United States.

Goodbye, GOP.;;-1.0;;;I believe Trump will  boldly go where no other president has gone before, putting self interest before country and the Republican party will follow suite in putting party before the institutions that make America great. Have they no shame, I think not. Simply put they do not care.  What can you expect from an opportunist for a President and his followers the Republican party?  He is only taking a page from the playbook of his favorite person, Vladimir Putin, by spreading misinformation, sowing confusion and doubt. It goes beyond dirty politics.  This just highlights the lengths that Trump and Republican Party will go to undermine the Russian investigation but the big question is why and what do they have to hide? ;"Republicans; no ethics, no morals, no scruples, no values, (other than opportunism and expediency), no principles, no programs (other than stealing from the poor to give to the rich), no compassion, no patriotism. Crooks, liars, racists, bigots, xenophobes, homophobes, misogynists, obstructionists, and with the 2016 election, traitors. They are just a bunch of craven political prostitutes for the Koch Brothers and assorted plutocrats, the NRA, faux Christian religious fascists, Big Pharma and insurance vultures, and now, for their Russian financers and handlers.  They need to be removed, for once and for all, permanently, from American political life, beginning in 2018 and ending in 2020<br/>And they need to pay criminal penalties for 40 years of poisoning our politics. ";The GOP don’t care about transparency, honesty, fairness, or good governance. They also seem immune to shame and allergic to the truth.<br/><br/>Here’s the sad thing. It doesn’t matter. GOP voters don’t care that Trump refused to release his taxes. They don’t care the GOP is doing nothing, and in fact encouraging, open grifting by Trump. (Example: this week the congressional GOP leadership held a conference at a Trump property). They don’t care Trump is a misogynist, accused of sexual harassment by almost 20 women, a compulsive liar, barely works part time and spends vast amounts of taxpayer money traveling almost every week on vacation to a Trump for profit private property, and completely incompetent. None of this matters to them and their voters.<br/><br/>The GOP Congress and its voters are only interested in imposition of their policies on America: tax cuts primarily for the rich and large corporations, stripping millions of health care, hiking the deficit, gutting Social Security, Medicaid, and Medicare, voter suppression, unlimited guns everywhere, even in the hands of terrorists, criminalizing abortion, and making the air dirtier and water undrinkable.<br/><br/>And guess what: a lot of this agenda is happening. And many people seem to not care about any of it. Our country is devolving into something scary and unrecognizable right before our eyes.;It's unfortunate that the Republicans by and large have gone straight to the least common denominator (Donald J.Trump) when it comes to integrity and principle.  We are in a deeply disfunctional hyper-partisan era for the republic, which currently looks more like a kleptocracy.;"The fact of the matter is that Nunes is a Trump lap dog and is oblivious to the depths that he is involved with the seriousness of his actions. These ""tea party"" Republicans have only one thing in mind, and that is to destroy our democracy. ";We are witnessing nothing less than the systematic dismantling of American democracy, something Republicans have shown great disdain for for quite a few years now.

The equating of global trade with industrial job loss continues to animate the dialog of americans that have less than college educations. <br/><br/>Populism of the Trump variety served up the usual offenders and labeled them enemies of the working people. Interestingly all the offenders were foreign countries and amazingly the solution was going to be to block imports by creating tax barriers, which in turn would allow him to lower taxes on corporate America…This solution would do nothing but increase costs for consumers  and american businesses . <br/><br/>Once again Trump has discovered that along with healthcare , trade is complicated and once again his base voters will be disappointed  on discovering how his agenda focuses more on tax reduction for the wealthy and corporations and not on helping american industrial workers thrive in the modern world. At some point  the Trump base will catch on to this charade…hopefully this will happen sooner than later. ;Trump's idea of nirvana is a lawless and  unregulated but well militarized world where corporate interests may pillage without restraint. Trade negotiation is a joke to him, he never kept a payment agreement with a contractor in his life. He seeks bi-lateral agreements because it's easier to stiff one country than 10. Additionally, his bluster is highly hypocritical. He pretends to have concern about American jobs, but all Trump (and Ivanka's) products were made cheaply abroad. Trump's elderly white male base will start winning very soon. Those who were lucky enough to hang on to the mid-western family grain, soybean or hog farms will lose them. The cost of their healthcare will skyrocket (see NYT article on imports of Chinese medical devices). Those who have stock dependent pensions will see them evaporate in a damaged stock market. And this is the tip of the iceberg. Just remember, when Trump wins, he wins bigly.;"Predictably Trump is reneging on his ""populist"" promises.  He promised tax raises on the rich, but that didn't even last through the campaign. His promises on health care resulted in a fiasco.  He would have a hard time fulfilling his promises on trade and immigration even if he were sincere about them, because the big-money interests which back the Republican party (and the Democratic party) make profits from international trade and outsourcing and from encouraging immigration of low-wage workers.  Many Republican-voting small business people would be very unhappy if immigrant labor was cut off.<br/><br/>But the huge trade deficit and outsourcing of jobs continue to be major factors in the stagnation of wages and growth of inequality.  Clearly globalization has not produced the promised boost in overall growth or economists would not be talking about ""secular"" stagnation. Krugman and other Times writers try to shrug these things off by saying the trade situation can't be changed now or that it's all the fault of robots - apparently the American worker is just supposed to suck it up and accept whatever handouts the government may decide to provide.  If the Democratic party (or some progressive party) does not get behind policies which would actually reduce inequality the country may be vulnerable to a really competent rightist demagogue (or party).";"Trump campaigned on what sounded good to his voters.

Newman without going into depth about some other factors he illuminated regarding opium-smoking in Qing-era China. Namely, that of the population of addicted, daily users, only a small subset were disabled by it.<br/><br/>This was a time and place where much of modern medicine was unavailable - either in the form of other painkillers like NSAIDs or surgical therapies for joint or other ailments. For many of those daily users, the pipe was their only remedy from suffering, and many of the smaller set of users disabled by constant smoking would have been crippled by pain without it anyways.<br/><br/>The rest of the overall group of daily users lived perfectly normal lives - they smoked their daily portion and went about their business. Opium smoking doesn't have the same escalation factor as other opiate derivatives - a user can take the same dose with the same effect indefinitely, without a tolerance that constantly builds.<br/><br/>Finally, it's difficult to impossible to overdose when smoking opium. Taken in a series of single pipefuls, a user will simply fall asleep if they start overdoing it. Its impact on health and safety is considerably less than what we see with heroin and fentanyl today.<br/><br/>Outlawing opium didn't eliminate it, it only built and drove a black-market alternative, where more easily smuggled, more dangerous drugs like heroin became the norm. I think we'd all be better off with opium dens, quite frankly.;0.6084758639335632;5adb8334068401528a2a9f74;5adb8334068401528a2a9f74;;;;;;

482;paraphrase-MiniLM-L12-v2;"The NYT editors begin with some very important observations but then quickly veer right back into the same ole hack political agenda we've all heard for decades.  Opium addiction only becomes a national crisis when some rich kid from NYC dies of an overdose on a Vermont farm.   Otherwise, all we ever hear from the NYTs is an argument about how a ""war on Drugs"" is doomed to failure....even though thats precisesly what China waged and WON in order to become the powerhouse it is today.  I am not sure whether methadone clinics were part of the Chinese strategy....";;-1.0;;;I doubt the history of the opium wars is neither forgotten nor forgiven by the Chinese rulers.  Our problem is its payback time.  It's probably not all that hard for their government to crack down on the labs but I argue that they don't because they want a devastating epidemic to continue bleeding our nation. ;"A Reefer Madness editorial from the Times - channeling the same history that went into a famous Sherlock Holmes story about opium addiction in the Victorian Era (""The Man with the Twisted Lip"").  Yes, opium has been around for centuries, and its effects can be dire.  Yes, people are dying from overdoses right now.  But (as several commenters have already noted) this has led to an instant scorched earth policy on the part of physicians in the US, so who knows how many thousands of people who (a) don't abuse prescription painkillers, and (b) are at no risk of addiction, are being denied the medication they need to function as human beings, in order to satisfy a public narrative that ""something must be done.""  It's undoubtedly a wrenching dilemma, but I find the all-or-nothing melodrama, the lack of nuance espoused by the public press, to be part and parcel of the problem";"Thank you to the editors of the NYT for keeping up the public pressure on the government and for keeping the public aware of the devastation that opioids are wreaking on our country and its people.  The number of overdose deaths is relatively tiny to the number of people adversely affected by this disease...multiply by at least by the number of parents and siblings who suffer never ending stress, who pay thousands of dollars to rehab facilities in the hope that they will help turn around their loved one's disease, usually without success.<br/><br/>My daughter's addiction physician told me ""If there is an evil in the world, it is heroin - it is truly hell on earth.""  Having lived with my daughter's heroin addiction for 7 years, and just found out about my other daughter's addiction to alcohol, cocaine, and now heroin for ten years, I can attest to the truth of that statement.<br/><br/>We need our leaders to help us battle this enemy, and we need our neighbors to find the compassion to help us.";This editorial quotes R.K. Newman without going into depth about some other factors he illuminated regarding opium-smoking in Qing-era China. Namely, that of the population of addicted, daily users, only a small subset were disabled by it.<br/><br/>This was a time and place where much of modern medicine was unavailable - either in the form of other painkillers like NSAIDs or surgical therapies for joint or other ailments. For many of those daily users, the pipe was their only remedy from suffering, and many of the smaller set of users disabled by constant smoking would have been crippled by pain without it anyways.<br/><br/>The rest of the overall group of daily users lived perfectly normal lives - they smoked their daily portion and went about their business. Opium smoking doesn't have the same escalation factor as other opiate derivatives - a user can take the same dose with the same effect indefinitely, without a tolerance that constantly builds.<br/><br/>Finally, it's difficult to impossible to overdose when smoking opium. Taken in a series of single pipefuls, a user will simply fall asleep if they start overdoing it. Its impact on health and safety is considerably less than what we see with heroin and fentanyl today.<br/><br/>Outlawing opium didn't eliminate it, it only built and drove a black-market alternative, where more easily smuggled, more dangerous drugs like heroin became the norm. I think we'd all be better off with opium dens, quite frankly.;"Perhaps, but treading carefully can sometimes be the worst course of action. I strongly recommend doing some research into methadone clinics in the 1970s. They were enormously effective, until the ""Just Say No"" movement of the 1980s took hold. <br/><br/>The reality is that opioid addiction cannot be successfully treated if we take an ""all or nothing"" approach. These other substances can be a safer alternative that quiet the cravings without muddying the person's thinking and inducing a ""high."" That helps an addict regain control of his or her life, without the constant, looming urge to relapse undermining their efforts at every turn.";First, look to cause.  Note how the graph shows rising drug death rates after lessez-faire capitalism came into vogue with the election of Reagan.  The middle class was put under pressure.  When people's lives are a wreck, they seek relief in drugs.<br/><br/>Second, blaming everyone except the addict is politically attractive, but not right.  People choose to take drugs.  While not harmless, time release opioids can help those with chronic pain.  We should not be telling patients to just live with pain.  Who should be protected, the millions who use pain medications responsively or the much smaller number who abuse drugs?

Crooks, liars, racists, bigots, xenophobes, homophobes, misogynists, obstructionists, and with the 2016 election, traitors. They are just a bunch of craven political prostitutes for the Koch Brothers and assorted plutocrats, the NRA, faux Christian religious fascists, Big Pharma and insurance vultures, and now, for their Russian financers and handlers.  They need to be removed, for once and for all, permanently, from American political life, beginning in 2018 and ending in 2020<br/>And they need to pay criminal penalties for 40 years of poisoning our politics. ";There is only one rational conclusion that you can draw from this debacle. The Republican Party has at last abandoned all pretense that they support the constitution, democracy, and the rule of law.  They have been co-opted into a cult of personality.  A cult of personality that has no use for civility, honesty,  and the fundamental moral mores that have historically defined the values of this country. ;"The Republican party has dropped all pretense of what they’re about. They forsook their party’s legacy of fiscal conservatism, moral leadership, national security &amp; global stability and law &amp; order. Blind fealty to a party’s donor class has thoroughly corrupted the party of Lincoln, Roosevelt, Eisenhower and Reagan. Theirs is not fealty to Trump—he's just the conduit to the GOP's function and loyalty: rationalized greed. Here's the new, shameless Republican Party brand: NATIONAL DEBT EXPLODERS, PUTIN-DEFENDERS, SABOTEURS of LAW ENFORCEMENT and let's not overlook their embrace of a CHILD MOLESTER. Your GOP—No moral compass or math skills required!";"Why is the GOP still a ""thing?"" I know there are some decent, honorable Republicans in Congress, but most of the party's members seem to spend all their time and effort 1) undermining our laws, institutions and ideals, 2) making willfully stupid blunders in economic, environmental, diplomatic (etc.) policy, and 3) seeing how much fear and misery they can inflict upon ""the other 99%"" by cutting social programs, deporting innocent people and pushing the interests of their Sugar Daddy donors like the NRA. <br/><br/>Americans deserve better, and I believe we'll get it on November 6th.";Speaking as one who left the Republican Party after I grew too disgusted by their careening towards extremism to even consider waiting them out (reactionaries tend to flock from one movement to another, after all), the GOP just doesn't exist as a credible party anymore. Some lines, once crossed, can't be undone, and this new Republican Party, this Trumpliban, will never recover respectability.;The Republican Party is a ship of fools.
